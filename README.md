# GroceryMe
This is the first project that me and my friends made while learning web dev. It is a part of our college curriculum.

# Abstract
GroceryMe revolutionizes shopping by connecting customers and
retailers seamlessly. Explore a wide range of products and choose
between convenient pick-up or delivery options. Experience
confidence through hands-on quality assessment before making a
purchase. The innovative "Kirana" concept allows loyal customers to
pay at the end of the month, fostering strong retailer-customer
relationships. Change the way you shop for groceries and essential
products and say goodbye to long queues and limited choices, and
say hello to GroceryMe.

# Results
In summary, GroceryMe enables easy registration and login for both
consumers and retailers. Consumers can shop from multiple product
categories, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Retailers
can add and manage their products, track Kirana Registrations,
Kirana Purchases, and Normal Purchases. GroceryMe provides a
streamlined and efficient platform for a seamless shopping
experience.

# Conclusion
A web development mini project creating an online grocery market
website. Features include user registration, product browsing, cart,
and checkout. Consumers and retailers can register/login, shop from
categories, and checkout. Retailers can add products and view
transactions. Overcame challenges with research and feedback.
Functional website for convenient grocery shopping. Future
improvements for enhanced features and user experience.

# Note
THIS PROJECT IS WRONG ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS, it was our first project while learning about web dev. We hope to rebuild this project some day and make it more efficient and organized on a real time basis.
This project is added to gitHub as a part of our progress towards mastering web dev.
